  (#639)
- Split the `receipts-account` worker type into `account-data` and `receipts` workers.

  Full Changelog:
  * [v1.133.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.133.0)

  (#577)
- Upgrade Matrix Authentication Service to v0.18.0.

  Full Changelog:
  * [v0.18.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v0.18.0)

  (#578)
- Document how to re-run integration tests from scratch. (#579)
- Better document uninstallation of, and the stores of state managed by the chart. (#585)
- Don't push chart OCI images for every PR. (#589, #591)
- Tweak changelog sections ordering. (#600)

### Fixed

- Fix Matrix RTC SFU `ServiceMonitor` not working. (#569)
- Fix Matrix Authentication Service not using the `hostAliases` set in the values. (#573)
- Fix Matrix RTC Authoriser not having default `hostAliases` values. (#573)
- Fix Postgres and Synapse Media `storageClassName` configuration not being respected.

  **Warning** Previously `synapse.media.storage.storageClass` and `postgres.storage.storageClass`
  were in the values file and associated schema. These values were accidentally silently ignored
  and all chart-managed `PersistentVolumeClaims` were constructed without `spec.storageClassName`
  set, using the cluster default `StorageClass`.

  The values file and associated schema have been updated so that the values are now
  `synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` and `postgres.storage.storageClassName`. The previous
  values are disallowed by the schema. Setting these values after the initial install could 
  cause the `PersistentVolumeClaims` to be recreated, with associated data-loss. Only set
  `synapse.media.storage.storageClassName` or `postgres.storage.storageClassName` on initial
  installation. (#582, #583)

### Removed

- Remove Matrix RTC Authoriser `ServiceMonitor` as the Authoriser has no metrics endpoint. (#569)
- Remove `hostAliases` support from Matrix RTC SFU as it doesn't make outbound requests. (#574)

### Internal

- CI: test that the default values includes stub settings (and thus comments) for various properties. (#573)
- CI: test that `hostAliases` are correctly set for all workloads that make outbound requests. (#573, #574)
- CI: improve the test cluster setup for Matrix RTC. (#579)
- CI: improve testing of chart managed `PersistentVolumeClaims`. (#582)
- CI: test nodeSelectors are appropriately configured. (#583)
- CI: simplify which commit we checkout. (#586)
- CI: switch to using `pull_request` triggers. (#586)
- CI: don't push artifacthub metadata on PRs. (#589)
- CI: be explicit about what permissions are workflow/job requires. (#589)
- CI: allow dyff job to work on forks. (#589, #594)
- Tests: don't check services matching labels against terminating pods. (#595, #598)
- Add `yamllint` ct dependency to poetry.toml. (#596)
- Prepare for 25.7.0 release. (#597)
- CI: run the preview-changelog job on main and manually as well as PRs. (#599)
