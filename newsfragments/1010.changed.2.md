Set default permissions on Hookshot so that local users only have permissions to manage integrations and connections.

Permissions should be adjusted to give specific users the ability to administer integrations, e.g.
```yaml
hookshot:
  additional:
    permissions.yaml:
      config: |
        permissions:
        - actor: {{ $.Values.serverName | quote }}
          services:
          - service: "*"
            level: manageConnections
        - action: "@an-admin-user:{{ $.Values.serverName }}"
          services:
          - service: "*"
            level: admin
```
