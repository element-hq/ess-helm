Added support for external Redis configuration (`synapse.redis`, `hookshot.redis`) allowing use of managed Redis services (AWS Elasticache, Azure Cache for Redis, etc.) instead of the internal Redis deployment. Each Redis-using component uses the chart Redis unless it has been independently configured with an external Redis. When external Redis is configured for all components, the internal Redis Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, and ServiceAccount are automatically skipped.
