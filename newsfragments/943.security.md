Fix critical security issue tracked as `ELEMENTSEC-2025-1670`.

This release is a critical security update to address an issue affecting all versions of ESS Community and ESS Pro. ESS Classic and other Synapse-based deployments are not affected.

The issue only has an impact when federation APIs are exposed to an untrusted network. Deployments that are not currently federating, or that only federate in a closed, trusted federation, are not impacted. These deployments should not enable public federation without first applying this update.

We advise you to apply the update as quickly as possible.
